        <h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;  Who are we</h3>
        <p class="p-1 text-justify">In this part of the company profile, you will need to include a brief introduction to your company, including
            where, when, and by whom the company was founded, the company's mission statement, and/or the company's
            vision and purpose. You don't necessarily have to include products or services in this section yet, but
            focus on your bigger meaning, and how you stand out from competitors instead. Tell your story in a
            compelling way. For instance, HubSpot starts their About Us section with, "More than ten years ago, we had a
            vision — an inbound world". HubSpot doesn't mention their products until further down the page.
            Additionally, their initial introduction is this: "Bring inspiration and innovation to every athlete* in the
            world.” The asterisk implies, "If you have a body, you are an athlete.” As you scroll, you'll see
            information on their internal diversity and inclusion initiative, their global community impact, and their
            sustainable business program, with very little mention of their products.</p>
